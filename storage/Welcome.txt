Welcome to the Home Server Project!

This project is designed to help you set up and manage a personal home server using Docker. 
A home server allows you to centralize your data, host applications, 
and manage services for your personal or family use. 

With this setup, you can run various services like 
file storage, media streaming, home automation, and moreâ€”all from the comfort of your own home.

Key Features:
- Easy deployment using Docker containers.
- Scalable and customizable to fit your needs.
- Secure and private, with full control over your data.

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand this project to suit your requirements. Happy hosting!
